# Epidemic
Simulation study on epidemic  based on Network Science. 
COVID-19 as a new type of virus was announced as epidemics and had made huge impact on human society. Those different simulation models
are built to study about the spread of COVID-19.

First of all, there are some assumptions for the simulation models which assumptions are based on the characteristics and status of COVID-19. 
The assumptions of virus as follow:
1. All the healthy people can be infected by their infected neighbours with a probability that follows the logarithmic distribution.
2. All the infected people can recovery with a certain probability that follows the normal distribution.
3. All the infected people will died with a probability that follows an inverse function.
4. For the scenario that consider the asymptomatic virus carriers, the rate that the patient show some symptom is linear increase.
